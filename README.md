Welcome to the setup guide for creating your own DeFi Kingdom clone on the Avalanche network. This README will walk you through the necessary steps to set up an EVM subnet, define your native currency, connect to MetaMask, and deploy the essential smart contracts for your game.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MetaMask (browser extension)
- Solidity and Remix (for smart contract development)

## Step 1: Set Up Your EVM Subnet

To create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network, follow these steps:

1. **Consult the Avalanche Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the Avalanche subnet and EVM documentation.
2. **Use Our Guide**: Refer to our comprehensive guide which details the process of setting up an EVM subnet specifically tailored for game development.

## Step 2: Define Your Native Currency

Your game will require a native currency for transactions. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Specify Currency Parameters**: Decide on the name, symbol, and initial supply of your native currency.
2. **Deploy the Currency**: Use Solidity to write a smart contract for your currency. Deploy it using Remix or any other preferred development environment.

## Step 3: Connect to MetaMask

To interact with your EVM subnet, you need to connect it to MetaMask:

1. **Open MetaMask**: Click on the MetaMask icon in your browser.
2. **Add Network**: Go to settings, select "Networks", and click "Add Network".
3. **Enter Network Details**: Input the network name, RPC URL, chain ID, symbol, and block explorer URL (if available).
4. **Save and Connect**: Save the network and connect your MetaMask to your custom EVM subnet.

Follow our detailed guide for more information on configuring MetaMask:

## Step 4: Deploy Basic Building Blocks

Now it's time to deploy the smart contracts that will serve as the foundation of your game:

1. **Write Smart Contracts**: Use Solidity to write contracts for different game elements such as battling, exploring, and trading.
2. **Deploy Contracts**: Use Remix or any other development tool to deploy these contracts on your EVM subnet.

### Additional Components

- **Liquidity Pools**: Set up smart contracts to manage liquidity for in-game transactions.
- **Token Contracts**: Define and deploy additional tokens needed for your game economy.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have set up your own DeFi Kingdom clone with a custom EVM subnet, native currency, MetaMask connectivity, and essential game smart contracts. For more detailed instructions, refer to our full guides linked above.
